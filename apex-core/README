APEX Core 
=========

Android is the first mass-produced consumer-market open source
mobile platform that allows developers to easily create 
applications and users to readily install them. However, giving 
users the ability to install third-party applications poses 
serious security concerns. While the existing security 
mechanism in Android allows a mobile phone user to see which 
resources an application requires, she has no choice but to 
allow access to all the requested permissions if she wishes to 
use the applications. There is no way of granting some 
permissions and denying others. Moreover, there is no way of 
restricting the usage of resources based on runtime constraints 
such as the location of the device or the number of times a 
resource has been previously used. 

In this paper, we present Apex -- a policy enforcement framework 
for Android that allows a user to selectively grant permissions 
to applications as well as impose constraints on the usage of 
resources. We also describe an extended package installer that 
allows the user to set these constraints through an easy-to-use 
interface. Our enforcement framework is implemented through a 
minimal change to the existing Android code base and is backward 
compatible with the current security mechanism.
